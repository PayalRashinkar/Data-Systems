Please note:

1. As mentioned in the description, since every file needs to seamlessly run independently of other queries, I have created separate databases for each query. Examples are Q1_database, Q2_database
   , and so on. Doing this will help the graders run each SQL file independently of others.
2. Uploading each SQL file and executing it completely should provide you with the expected output.
3. Database used is MySQLWorkbench which is installed locally.
